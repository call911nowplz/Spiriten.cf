# Server Jars

The core of a Minecraft server is the Jar it runs on. This is the software that the server is running. Depending on which you use your 
performance, server abilities, and support may change.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft Server Jars I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Bukkit | A-Z
Server software that runs on the Bukkit API (non-Hybrid servers)

**If next to the name of the jar I have added these double astericks it is because that the developer of that jar mass produces resources. This 
leads to a lack of support, lack of updates, and quick abandonement.
  
[AirPlane](https://github.com/Technove/Airplane) : AirPlane is a 1.16.x Tuinity fork attempting to create the top performing fork.

[Akarin](https://github.com/Akarin-project/Akarin) : Akarin is the new project of the [TorchSpigot](https://github.com/TorchSpigot/Torch) developers. It is currently a Tuinity 
fork aiming to become a multi-core compatible server software, but right now it is just a Tuinity fork with a lot of optimizations. The latest official release is for 1.15.2.

[APOLLO16](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16271/) : APOLLO16 is a premium 1.16.5 PurPur fork with a built in performance monitor and optimized block/chunk ticking methods.

[AtomSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14124/) : AtomSpigot is a 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork with crash fixes, async hit detectionm / knockback, and some general 
optimizations. Currently it is not available through legal means due to a false ban off of MC-Market.

[aSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/6101/)** : aSpigot is a premium 1.7.10 Paper fork with custom knockback editing, togglable things like mob AI, and various features 
pointed at HCF servers.

[BeerSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/355569/) : BeerSpigot is a $75 premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork focused on Factions servers. Some of its features include its custom 
knockback editing and built in Factions features like grace period or global spawner values.

[BeeSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14263/)** : BeeSpigot is a premium 1.15.2 Paper fork with custom knockback editing, togglable things like mob AI, and some 
general optimizations.

[BreadSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/475910/) : BreadSpigot is a $75 premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork aimed at SkyBlock servers by having huge mob optimizations, a built 
in mobstacker, and custom knockback editing.

[CraftBukkit](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) : CraftBukkit is the foundation that most servers are built on today. It was a slightly edited copy of 
[Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) but with Bukkit capabilities. This meant it could run server side mods, aka plugins. CraftBukkit supports 1.0.0 to 
1.16.5.

[Custom Spigot](https://mctrades.org/threads/1682/) : Creative name, right? Not much is known about it other than it being a premium Paper fork with custom knockback parameters,
hit detections optimizations, and "fast pot". It has been very much abandoned.

[DytanicSpigot](https://cloudnetservice.eu/repositories/de/dytanic/dytanicspigot-api/) : DytanicSpigot was a 1.8.8 Spigot fork said to be capable of a stable 40 tps. Currently 
the whole server jar isn't found as it has been lost to time, with only the API backed up. From what I've heard, the creator was doxed/blackmailed.

[ElapsedSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/480567/) : A 1.8.8 premium TacoSpigot fork aimed at Factions servers with built in features like a mobstacker and configurable 
block durabilities.

[EmpireCraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft) : A 1.9 to 1.16.5 Spigot/Paper fork used on the EmpireCraft server meant as a testing ground for new potential 
optimizations before sending them off to Spigot/Paper (as well as just some changes they like). It is developed by Aikar (the guy who made the infamous startup flags) so it does 
have a bit of backing too.

[encer](https://github.com/CraftLight-Network/encer) : encer is a 1.16.5 PurPur/Airplane fork hoping for top performance. Currently there are no releases.

[FoxSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/8592/)** : A 1.8.8 Spigot fork with custom knockback editing, multi-threading support, and togglable things like mob AI.

[GAT](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/193845/) : GAT was a premium Spigot fork being sold for $50. I say was as it was taken down due to the creator scamming people. It had
major incompatibilities with plugins but atleast it had features like custom knockback and small optimizations! It was not worth the money...

[Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone) : Glowstone was an attempt at rewriting a Minecraft server from the ground up with multi-core abilities while keeping 
BukkitAPI compatibility. Today Glowstone is slowly being updated.

[GuardSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14497/) : GuardSpigot is a 1.8.8 $99 premium TacoSpigot fork with features like custom knockback editing, lag machine 
detection, and a bunch of things you can toggle like mob AI for performance gain / gameplay change.

[HOSE](https://github.com/softpak/HOSE) : HOSE was an attempt at adding multi-core support on a Spigot fork in 1.11.2. It has a release, but is abandoned today. 

[Imanity Spigot 2](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/10770/) : A 1.8.8 premium Paper fork with configurable cave generation, built in 1.7 - 1.16 client compatiblity, and many 
stability optimizations.

support.

[LightSpigot 1.8.8](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/17753/) : LightSpigot 1.8.8 is a free server jar with some general world optimizations, PvP optimizations, and HCF based 
features like pearling through slabs.

[LightSpigot 1.16.5](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/17753/) : LightSpigot 1.16.5 is a premium server jar with some spawner / general performance optimizations and custom 
knockback editing.

[mSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/6864/)** : mSpigot is a 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork with multi-threading support, custom knockback profiles, and some PvP fixes that 
seemed to be aimed at Factions/KitPvP servers.

[NachoSpigot](https://github.com/CobbleSword/NachoSpigot) : NachoSpigot is a 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork aimed at bringing modern patches and optimizations to 1.8. It seems abandoned 
though as there have been no edits in months. The support discord is also dead, so do not expect any support.

[NitroSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13230/)** : NitroSpigot is a premium 1.7.10 fork of Spigot with lots of HCF based optimizations. There's some neat stuff like
a lot of optimizations, built in dependencies, and custom knockback - but may be iffy due to the creator mass producing resources.

[nSpigot 2.0 Enterprise](https://mctrades.org/threads/15860/)** : nSpigot 2.0 Enterprise was a premium 1.8.9 Spigot fork with claims of custom knockback parameters, full 
multicore/multithread capabilities, able to run 20tps with 800 players, and version 1.7.x - 1.12.x support built in. When asked for proof of ownership, the developer 
magically disappeared.

[Origami](https://github.com/Minebench/Origami/) : Origami is a Tuinity/Paper fork created for the Minebench.de server network. I believe it supports 1.15 to 1.16.4.

[PaperMC](Papermc.io) : Paper is a 1.6.4 - 1.16.5 super optimized version of Spigot that introduced a lot of new features too.

[PerfectSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/5376/) : PerfectSpigot is a 1.8.8 Paper fork focused on Factions with optimized cannoning, built in 1.7 - 1.15 client 
compatibility, and some general optimizations.

[pSpigot Lite](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/6946/) : pSpigot Lite is a free 1.7.10 Paper fork. It has some performance optimizations, some custom messages,
and some new commands (like for Discord, Teamspeak, Store, etc). It's pretty basic, but free so you can't complain.

[PurPlane](https://github.com/notOM3GA/Purplane) : A 1.16.5 (?) fork of PurPur and Airplane for  maximum optimization. It has been discontinued.

[PurPur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/) : PurPur is a fork of Tuinity supporting 1.14.x to 1.16.x, adding some more optimization and more configuration options.

[RainForest](https://github.com/Proximyst/Rainforest) : RainForest is a 1.16.1 - 1.16.5 Paper fork with optimizations that they're testing out/optimizations that they plan to 
keep to themselves.

[RocketMC](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13898/) : RocketMC is a premium 1.15.2 Tuinity fork with a built in monitoring system, plugin manager (enabling/disabling/command 
information), and some general performance optimizations.

[SaturneSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/18739/) : SaturneSpigot is a premium 1.8.8 fork of Smart's Spigot with no extra features. The only better thing is that it
costs less.

[Smart's Spigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16026/) : Smart's Spigot is a premium 1.8.8 fork of SpigotX (I cannot find SpigotX anywhere...) with some small (from what
I can tell) fixes. It has some features like custom knockback, tnt/cannon fixes, built in commands like ping or setslots, and an automatic server optimizer. It has been
discontinued though, I would not recommend buying it.

[SparklyPaper](https://github.com/SparklyPower/SparklyPaper) : SparklyPaper is a Tuinity/Paper fork aimed at providing personal patches for the creator that may be seen
as weird/crazy. It supports 1.16.x as far as I am aware.

[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) : Spigot took over the job of [CraftBukkit](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) after legal issues came since 
CraftBukkit used code from Mojang's server software. Spigot also introduced various optimizations and new abilities. Spigot supports 1.4.6 - 1.16.5.

[SportBukkit](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/SportBukkit) : SportBukkit is a 1.12.2 (I think) fork of CraftBukkit improving stability and adding some new features. It was 
developed for and by the StratusNetwork server.

[SportPaper](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/SportPaper) : SportPaper is a 1.8.8 fork of Paper improving performance even more. It is developed for and by the StratusNetwork 
server.

[SSSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14122/) : SSSpigot is a premium 1.16.5 Paper fork with multi-thread support, useless code removed, some general optimizations, and 
tracking metrics disabled.

[StellarSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/523827/) : StellarSpigot is a $300 premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork with a large assortment of optimizations aimed at Factions 
servers.

[SternalSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/18663/)** : SternalSpigot is a premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork that tries to move a lot of processes to an async system, has 
some general optimizations, and has some knockback profiles to switch between for different results.

[TacoSpigot](https://tacospigot.github.io/) : A 1.8.8 fork of Paper adding some performance and PvP optimizations.

[TorchSpigot](https://github.com/TorchSpigot/Torch) : TorchSpigot is an abandoned attempt at bringing multi-core capabilities to a Paper fork. It never had any releases, but the 
GitHub is still up. Today, the developers have moved onto a new iteration of it called [Akarin](https://github.com/Akarin-project/Akarin).

[Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity) : Tuinity is a 1.13.2 to 1.16.4 fork of Paper with various performance patches by SpottedLeaf.

[uSpigot 1.0](https://mctrades.org/threads/15859/) : uSpigot 1.0 is a premium 1.8.9 Spigot fork with claims of full multicore/multithread support, custom knockback parameters,
and many optimizations. It is made by the same developer as nSpigot 2.0 Enterprise, so very likely a scam.

[VapoSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/10936/) : VapoSpigot is a free 1.7.10 Paper fork aimed at PvP servers. It includes features like custom knockback parameters, 
a lot of optimizations, some Bukkit API additions, and built in 1.8.x support. It's amazing what you can get for free...

[Voltane Spigot](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/571429/) : Voltane Spigot is a premium 1.8.8 TacoSpigot fork with built in 1.7 - 1.16 client support, custom knockback

features/optimizations aimed at HCF.

[Yatopia](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia) : DO NOT USE. Yatopia is a 1.15.2 to 1.16.5 Tuinity fork aimed at top performance. To do this it combines optimizations from 
various Paper forks and Fabric performance mods and hopes it works. They will release completely broken server jars that can corrupt your world. AVOID YATOPIA.

[zSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/7198/) : zSpigot was a 1.7.10 Paper fork with custom knockback profiles, a built in server benchmarker, and various HCF/PvP 
optimizations. Ironically, the creator was banned for leaking products and now the only way to get his server jar is through it being leaked.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hybrid | A-Z
Server software that combine vanilla platforms and mod platforms.

[AtomMC](https://gitlab.com/AtomMC/Atom) : AtomMC is a 1.12.2 Forge/Spigot hybrid server software with performance as a top priority.

[ModLoaderMP](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloadermp) : ModLoaderMP was the first multiplayer mod loader, supporting from Beta 1.4 to release 1.5.2. It is currently abandoned
but is a neat piece of Minecraft history.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Other | A-Z
Server software that doesn't run on BukkitAPI

[CanaryMod](https://github.com/CanaryModTeam/CanaryMod) : A fork of hMod for implementing some of Bukkit's patches. Used on the MinecraftOnline server. Not sure what versions.

[Cauldron-js](https://github.com/vantezzen/cauldron-js) : Cauldron-js is just a proof of concept idea of running a 1.13.2 server entirely inside your web browser. Doesn't run 
great, but still an achievement.

[Cleanstone](https://github.com/CleanstoneMC/Cleanstone) | Cleanstone is a rewrite of Minecraft servers from the ground up to support multi-core usage. It currently supports 
1.12.2 - 1.14 and occasionally recieves updates, but no new releases.

[Cuberite](https://cuberite.org/) : Cuberite is a recode of Minecraft servers from the ground up with its own API and plugins. It currently supports 1.8 to 1.12.2.

[Feather](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather) : Feather is a recode of Minecraft servers entirely in the Rust programming language, aimed at making the server run
multicore - this would significantly increase performance. It currently only supports 1.16.5. Worth noting, their plugin API is not finished yet either.

[hMod](https://github.com/traitor/Minecraft-Server-Mod/) : The first server type with server side mods (plugins) supported. It supported early Alpha versions.

[LightStone](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/lightstone) : All the way back in 2011 in Alpha 1.0.16 an attempted multi-core Minecraft server project was made. It didn't head 
anywhere, but is the predecessor to the Glowstone project.

[McEx](https://github.com/McEx/McEx) : McEx was an experimental multi-core server written in rust and elixer, but was never released.

[MineStom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) : A 1.16.5 complete rewrite of Minecraft server. It removes all features (like the server knowing what a chest is) to be the 
ultimate plugin creator playground (no features in your way) as well as for the best optimization. It's not in a released state at the moment and pluginswill take longer to be 
developed on it.

[NeptuneVanilla](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneMod) : A continuation of CanaryMod under a new repository and name.

[Project-Rainbow](https://ci.codecrafter47.de/job/Rainbow/) : Project-Rainbow was an attempt at overthrowing Bukkit with a new platform, but as we can tell that didn't work.

[SpongeVanilla](https://www.spongepowered.org/) : SpongeVanilla exists for hosting a vanilla Minecraft server but with Sponge plugin support, it's like an alternative to Spigot.

[Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) : The Vanilla jar is the server software provided by Mojang themselves. It is the slowest and has the least abilities, 
but it is a plain vanilla experience.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

Out of all of this what do I recommend?

For newer versions use [PurPur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/). It's a reliable and fast software and the forks of it aren't too great yet.

For 1.8 use [Cuberite](https://cuberite.org/) if you are custom developing plugins, otherwise use [TacoSpigot](https://tacospigot.github.io/) or 
[LightSpigot 1.8.8](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16933/).

If you really need 1.7.10, whether that be for the PvP or stability, I liked [VapoSpigot](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/10936/). It's a free Paper fork with a lot of
optimizations, new additions, built in protocol support, and even custom knockback settings.

For a hybrid server? Personally I'd recommend [Magma](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma). I've had great experiences with it and it runs pretty well.

Premium software? I cannot recommend any of them. They all have their drawbacks and I have no experience running any of them.
